"""Executor that bridges Omnigent web-chat turns into the native qwen TUI.

It does not launch ``qwen`` — the ``omnigent qwen`` wrapper already launched the
interactive ``qwen`` TUI in the session terminal (with ``--input-file`` /
``--json-file``). Each web-UI turn appends a ``{"type":"submit",...}`` line to
that input file, which qwen's ``RemoteInputWatcher`` routes through the same
``submitQuery`` path the keyboard uses, so the message appears in the running TUI
(and, since the web UI embeds the pane, in both surfaces). Output is
terminal-originated; the embedded terminal renders it live and
:mod:`omnigent.harnesses.qwen_native.forwarder` mirrors the JSON event stream.

Unlike goose-/cursor-native (tmux ``send-keys``), injection here is an atomic
file append — no settle-detection, paste-commit polling, or draft-clearing. See
``docs/QWEN_NATIVE_DESIGN.md``.
