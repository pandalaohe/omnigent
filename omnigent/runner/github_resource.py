"""GitHub integration for the session workspace, backed by the ``gh`` CLI.

Powers the web UI's read-only "GitHub" rail tab, which is purely a PR view: the
changed-files list and the whole-PR patch come straight from GitHub via ``gh``
(``gh api .../pulls/<n>/files`` and ``gh pr diff``), so they match the PR's
"Files changed" exactly. With no PR for the branch the tab shows its "no PR"
empty state and fetches nothing.

Design notes:

- Commands run via plain :func:`subprocess.run` in the workspace root, NOT the
  sandboxed OS-env shell helper. The helper strips secrets from the environment,
  which would break ``gh`` auth; a plain subprocess inherits the runner process
  environment, so ``gh`` authenticates as it normally does — the developer's
  ``gh`` login in local dev, and in a managed sandbox the per-user ``hosts.yml``
  that :func:`omnigent.git_credential_github.configure_host_gh` writes from the
  credential broker at host startup. In a sandbox we additionally scrub
  ``GH_TOKEN``/``GITHUB_TOKEN`` from ``gh``'s env (gh ranks those *above*
  ``hosts.yml``), so a stray ambient token — e.g. a gh-MCP env passthrough —
  can't silently make the panel act as a shared identity instead of the
  connected owner. Outside a sandbox the env is inherited untouched.
- The list and patch are GitHub-computed, never a local ``git diff``, so a stale
  local ``origin/<base>`` can't inflate them with files outside the PR.
- Only the on-demand per-file expand-context reader (:func:`github_file_diff`)
  still uses ``git show`` for full before/after content — a unified-diff blob
  can't drive the viewer's context expansion.
- The branch→PR lookup resolves in one ``gh`` call, picked by whether the pushed
  ref (``branch.<name>.merge``) was renamed from the local branch — the mark of
  a fork / triangular push (Databricks prefixes it with ``<user>/``). Renamed →
  ``gh pr list --head <pushed-ref>``, which matches the head ref name alone and
  so finds a fork head a bare ``gh pr view`` misses. Not renamed → a bare ``gh pr
  view``, which is correct and more precise for same-repo branches and returns
  nothing for a base branch like ``master`` (``gh pr list --head master`` would
  wrongly match a stranger's PR whose head merely shares the name).
- ``available: false`` payloads let the tab render a message ("gh not installed",
  "not a git repo") instead of surfacing an error.
