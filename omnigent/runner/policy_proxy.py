    Proxy a policy evaluation request from the harness to the Omnigent server.

    Called by the runner's ``proxy_stream`` when it intercepts a
    ``policy_evaluation.requested`` SSE event from the harness. Posts
    the evaluation request to the Omnigent server's
    ``POST /sessions/{id}/policies/evaluate`` endpoint, then delivers
    the verdict back to the harness as a ``policy_verdict`` inbound
    event.

    Transient transport errors and 5xx responses are retried within the
    phase's policy budget before the default below applies, so a short
    outage does not flip the gate for an in-flight tool call.

    On failure (AP unreachable, non-200, malformed response) the default
    verdict is phase-aware:

    - ``PHASE_LLM_REQUEST`` / ``PHASE_LLM_RESPONSE`` fail OPEN
      (``POLICY_ACTION_ALLOW``) so a transient Omnigent outage does not
      hang the turn — these gates are advisory.
    - ``PHASE_TOOL_CALL`` fails CLOSED (``POLICY_ACTION_DENY``). For
      connector-native MCP tools the harness ``can_use_tool`` callback
      (which consumes this verdict) is the *only* enforcement point — the
      call is never re-checked server-side — so a policy that cannot be
      evaluated must not let the tool through.
    - ``PHASE_TOOL_RESULT`` fails OPEN: by the result phase the tool has
      already executed, so denying would only block an already-incurred
      side effect.

    :param server_client: HTTP client pointed at the Omnigent server.
    :param harness_client: HTTP client pointed at the harness subprocess.
    :param conversation_id: Session/conversation identifier,

    :param evaluation_id: Unique correlation id from the harness,
        e.g. ``"poleval_abc123"``.
    :param phase: Proto-style phase string, e.g.
        ``"PHASE_LLM_REQUEST"``.
    :param data: Event data dict for the policy engine.
    :param on_delivery_failure: Called with *conversation_id* when the verdict
        cannot be delivered after retry; wired by callers to cancel the wedged turn.
